            <p>Visual Studio is an IDE that helps us create and code webpages</p>
            <br>
            <p>Console screen is basically used to help us identify any bugs or errors in the code. 
            We use Console.log() to print any message or variable values.
        By clicking on inspect view we would be able to get to console.</p>
